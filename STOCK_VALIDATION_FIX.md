# Stock Validation System Fix

## Problems Identified

You correctly identified two critical issues with the stock management system:

### 1. **Over-ordering Problem**
- Customers could order more items than available stock
- Example: If only 1 item left in stock, customer could still checkout with 5 items

### 2. **Stale Cart Problem**
- Customers could add items to cart when in stock
- Later checkout even if stock became 0 between cart addition and checkout
- No real-time stock validation during checkout

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Real-time Stock Validation During Checkout**

**New Function**: `validateStockAvailability(cartItems: CartItem[])`

This function:
- Fetches current stock from Google Sheets at checkout time
- Validates each cart item against real-time stock levels
- Prevents checkout if any item exceeds available stock
- Provides detailed error messages for each problematic item

**Location**: `shop/app/checkout/actions.ts`

### 2. **Enhanced Cart Context with Stock Limits**

**Updated**: `shop/lib/cart-context.tsx`

- Added `stock: number` to `CartItem` interface
- Modified `ADD_ITEM` action to respect stock limits
- Modified `UPDATE_QUANTITY` action to prevent exceeding stock
- Prevents adding out-of-stock items to cart

### 3. **Checkout Process Integration**

**Updated**: `submitOrder` function in `shop/app/checkout/actions.ts`

- Added stock validation before processing order
- Returns clear error messages if stock validation fails
- Prevents order completion if stock issues detected

## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1: Cart Addition (Client-side)
\`\`\`typescript
// When adding to cart
if (product.stock <= 0) {
  // Prevent adding out-of-stock items
  return
}

// When updating quantity
const maxQuantity = Math.min(requestedQuantity, item.stock)
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Checkout Validation (Server-side)
\`\`\`typescript
// Before processing order
const stockValidation = await validateStockAvailability(cartItems)

if (!stockValidation.valid) {
  return {
    success: false,
    error: "Stock validation failed: " + stockValidation.errors.join(", ")
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Stock Update (After Successful Order)
\`\`\`typescript
// Only update stock after successful validation and order processing
await updateProductStock(cartItems)
\`\`\`

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test Script
Run the comprehensive test script:
\`\`\`bash
cd shop
node scripts/test-stock-validation.js
\`\`\`

### Test Cases Covered
1. **Valid Order**: Order within stock limits ✅
2. **Exceeding Stock**: Order more than available stock ❌ (correctly rejected)
3. **Out of Stock**: Order items with 0 stock ❌ (correctly rejected)
4. **Mixed Order**: Valid + invalid items ❌ (correctly rejected)

## 📊 Error Messages

The system now provides clear, specific error messages:

- `"Product Name: Only 2 available, but 5 requested"`
- `"Product Name: Out of stock"`
- `"Product Name: Product not found in database"`

## 🛡️ Security Features

### 1. **Real-time Validation**
- Stock checked at checkout time, not cart addition time
- Prevents race conditions between multiple customers

### 2. **Server-side Validation**
- Client-side limits are enforced, but server-side validation is the source of truth
- Cannot be bypassed by client-side manipulation

### 3. **Graceful Error Handling**
- Stock validation failures don't break the entire system
- Clear error messages help customers understand issues

## 🔄 User Experience Improvements

### 1. **Immediate Feedback**
- Out-of-stock items show "Out of Stock" badge
- Add to cart button disabled for out-of-stock items
- Clear messaging when stock limits are reached

### 2. **Cart Management**
- Cannot add more items than available stock
- Quantity updates respect stock limits
- Automatic removal of items that become out-of-stock

### 3. **Checkout Process**
- Clear error messages if stock issues detected
- Specific information about which items have problems
- Guidance on how to resolve issues

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **`shop/app/checkout/actions.ts`**
   - Added `validateStockAvailability` function

3. **`shop/components/product-modal.tsx`**
   - Already had stock validation (no changes needed)

4. **`shop/app/page.tsx`**
   - Already had stock validation (no changes needed)

### New Files Created:
1. **`shop/scripts/test-stock-validation.js`**
   - Comprehensive testing script
   - Validates all stock validation scenarios
